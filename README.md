# C++ run-time timers

This is a set of C++ stopwatch classes for gathering
statistics on the run-time performance of client code.
The classes will accumulate data on the time taken
for each start/stop interval, and report parameters
such as the minimum, maximum and average time
after the timer goes out of scope.
